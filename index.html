              <p>
                My go-to language. Its simple, flexible and makes concurrent
                solutions &mdash; like real-time interfaces &mdash; easy to
                build. It's

              <p>
                When working on frontend applications my language of choice is
                TypeScript &mdash; for now. It provides access to the vast
                JavaScript ecosystem while at the same time help make
                JavaScript's idiosyncrasies more manageable through it's
                typesystem.

              <p>
                The first programming language I learned and still the one I
                find the most wonderful to write. For any scripting or simple
                data processing Ruby remains my go-to.

              <h2>Kotlin</h2>
              <p>
                A mostly Object-Oriented language but highly influenced by
                functional languages like Scala, Erlang and ML which help with
                some of the shortcomings of Object Oriented programming. It's a
                swiss army knife and sometimes feels like Ruby, which makes it a
                pleasure to work with.

              <h2>Clojure</h2>
              <p>
                What attracts me the most to Clojure are the philosophy of the
                language and the ideas that come from its community. Its
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oytL881p-nQ">
                  challenging the way you think about programming</a
                >
                which leads you to create simpler and more sophisticated
                solutions. It can also run in many different environments like
                the JVM, JavaScript and .NET which means you can write it pretty
                much everywhere.

              <h2>ReasonML</h2>
              <p>
                The number one language that is most likely to replace
                TypeScript in my toolkit. It has an
                <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system"
                  >extremely nice type system</a
                >
                which is sound and gives it the feel of writing a dynamic
                language, simply because it figures out the types for you. And
                its compile times put other compile-to-js languages to shame.

              <p>
                Even though my main focus is on programming, I actually have a
                background in design. Because of this I can easily work with
                designers and help translate their ideas to code. For sketching
                out ideas and designs not a lot comes close to Sketch and its
                features.

              At <a href="http://wakoopa.com/">Wakoopa</a> I got my first job
              out of University. After doing my internship and thesis here, I
              became responsible for the frontend of its SaaS offering. I
              collaborated with UX Designers to design and implement single page
              applications using <a href="https://emberjs.com/">Ember</a> and
              <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>. I also worked on the

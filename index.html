            My go-to language. Its simple, flexible and makes concurrent

            It's

          <p>
            When working on frontend applications my language of choice is
            TypeScript &mdash; for now. It provides access to the vast
            JavaScript ecosystem while at the same time help make JavaScript's
            idiosyncrasies more manageable through it's typesystem.

          <p>
            The first programming language I learned and still the one I find
            the most wonderful to write. For any scripting or simple data
            processing Ruby remains my go-to.

        <div>
          <h2>Kotlin</h2>
          <p>
            A mostly Object-Oriented language but highly influenced by
            functional languages like Scala, Erlang and ML which help with some
            of the shortcomings of Object Oriented programming. It's a swiss
            army knife and sometimes feels like Ruby, which makes it a pleasure
            to work with.

        <div>
          <h2>Clojure</h2>
          <p>
            What attracts me the most to Clojure are the philosophy of the
            language and the ideas that come from its community. Its
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oytL881p-nQ">
              challenging the way you think about programming</a
            >
            which leads you to create simpler and more sophisticated solutions.
            It can also run in many different environments like the JVM,
            JavaScript and .NET which means you can write it pretty much
            everywhere.

        <div>
          <h2>ReasonML</h2>
          <p>
            The number one language that is most likely to replace TypeScript in
            my toolkit. It has an
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system"
              >extremely nice type system</a
            >
            which is sound and gives it the feel of writing a dynamic language,
            simply because it figures out the types for you. And its compile
            times put other compile-to-js languages to shame.

          <p>
            Even though my main focus is on programming, I actually have a
            background in design. Because of this I can easily work with
            designers and help translate their ideas to code. For sketching out
            ideas and designs not a lot comes close to Sketch and its features.

            For all your the diagramming, flowcharting and mindmapping needs
            look no further.
            <a href="https://whimsical.co">Whimsical</a> is the tool that gets
            out of the way and lets you focus on structuring your thoughts
            instead of fiddling with knobs and dials. Useful regardless if
            you're a designer or developer.

          no-code platform to help non-developers build business applications. I
          contributed to the migration from Ruby to Elixir and train new

          increasing the release frequency of features by streamlining our Git
          strategy and migrate the platform to Kubernetes on Azure.

          At <a href="http://wakoopa.com/">Wakoopa</a> I got my first job out of
          University. After doing my internship and thesis here, I became
          responsible for the frontend of its SaaS offering. I collaborated with
          UX Designers to design and implement single page applications using
          <a href="https://emberjs.com/">Ember</a> and
          <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>. I also worked on the rest
